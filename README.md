# Fitness Trainer Alarm Setup for Low-Calorie Rate

This project implements a fitness monitoring system using the LPC2148 microcontroller. The system helps users track their calorie burn rate and maintain a healthy lifestyle by providing real-time feedback through LEDs and a 7-segment display. It also counts workout repetitions to help users achieve their fitness goals efficiently.

## Features
- **Calorie Tracking:** Monitors calorie intake and burn rate.
- **Visual Feedback:** Uses LEDs to indicate calorie rate status.
- **Workout Reps Counter:** Displays total reps achieved on a 7-segment display.
- **Customizable Targets:** Allows users to set and adjust their calorie goals.
- **Interactive Interface:** Two switches for incrementing and decrementing calorie rate.
- **ARM-based Efficiency:** Utilizes the ARM7TDMI-S-based LPC2148 microcontroller for reliable performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller:** LPC2148 (ARM7-based)
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Simulation:** Proteus Design Suite
- **IDE:** Keil uVision IDE

## Future Enhancements
- Data logging and progress tracking over time.
- Integration with mobile apps or web interfaces for remote monitoring.
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi support for wireless connectivity.
- Real-time clock (RTC) module for time-based monitoring.

## How to Run
1. Set up the LPC2148 microcontroller circuit as per the provided schematic.
2. Program the microcontroller using Keil uVision IDE.
3. Simulate the circuit in Proteus or deploy it on actual hardware.
4. Use switches to input calorie targets and track progress via LEDs and the 7-segment display.
